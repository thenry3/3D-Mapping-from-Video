# a trash attempt at rendering a 3d scene from videos

well wat are the chances tht someones gonna read this. might as well have fun while writing this haha. anyway its like saturday after week 2 of spring quarter 2020 and its stupid quarantining season and i have nothing to do other than schoolwork, so this is what ive been doing in quarantine. i miss the vibe and everybody at school and its so depressing to be at home 24/7. was also looking forward to interning in seattle this summer but im gonna be home :'(

so i guess this is supposed to be a summary or story. well if y'all ~recruiters~people wanna know, i had a research lab interview at my school related to autonomous vehicles, and reading the description of what i needed to know, i saw SLAM. naturally i googled it and i came across it, and i googled a bunch of other stuff to make this project as well lmao.

## some shit you need
* [pangolin](https://github.com/uoip/pangolin) --> this gave me pain
* opencv --> to analyze photos (god bless goodfeaturestotrack lmao)
* pysdl2 --> dont u wanna see the cool little feature dots on ur video?

oh ye please note compile pangolin on linux, such as the chad ubuntu. i rlly like macOS or OS X, whatever the proper name is, but U CANT COMPILE PANGOLIN ~FOR SHIT~ . this problem caused me like 6 hours of my time so ima save all you boys and girls out there some time.
